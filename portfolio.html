    <h3>1. Flappybird</h3>
    
    <img id="prt" src="flappybird.png" alt="A picture of the flappybird game I coded. It includes a background of trees and clouds, with poles coming from both the top and bottom with a space in between for the bird to get through.">
    <p>This is a screenshot capture from one of the first games I coded. I worked very hard on this creation and it took much dedication and problem solving. It works like any other flappybird game with the point system and game end. I was very proud after making this game since I had never coded anything like it before and I was very excited about the final show of the project. The result convinced me that I was made to work in computer science. Although it wasn't perfect, it proved to me that there was room for improvement and eventually started my journey in coding. If there was one thing I could change about this project, I would have changed the speed of the flappybird because it was moving super slow and I couldn't figure out how to fix it at the time as it was already coded at the fastest speed. Other than that, I couldn't have loved this project more.</p>

    <h3>2. Space Invadors</h3>
    <img id="prt"src="space_invadors.png" alt="A picture of the space invadors game I coded. There is a blue arrow at the bottom that is shooting yellow bullets at the red circles throughout the screen.">
    <p>In this project, I was able to use a little more creativity than I had in the past because it wasn't a very common game. It reminds me of one of those games you would play on an arcade machine, like Pac Man. During the span of coding this game, I had already coded a couple of games so I was a little more patient. I had more experience and therefore was able to better troublshoot any obstacles I ran into. I was also very excited while playing the final result of this game because it turned out exactly how I wanted it to. This project was significant to me because it showed me that I was improving and getting better at coding.</p>

    <h3>3. Pong Game</h3>
    <img id="prt" src="pong.png" alt="A picture of the ping pong game I coded. It has a point system at the top of the screen with both players (squares) at opposite sides, left and right. There is a green ball bouncing back and forth between the players.">
    <p>I had made a pong game like this one earlier in my game making journey, but this was a remake I made for a school project. I used the first version I made as a base and added to it, making all the changes I wanted to make it perfect. I was very happy with the result of this game because it was exactly as I envisioned it and quite an upgrade from the original one I had made. The teacher was also very impressed with this project, and this was one of the first games I actually enjoyed playing for fun. This was one of my more recent games I made, but I still have room for improvement </p>
