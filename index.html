    <p>Hi! I'm Aashi, a freshman student who loves to code. I have always loved coding from a young age, and have made many games and websites. I finally found this wonderful program that can make my coding dreams come true. I aspire to be a computer science engineer when I grow up and I can't wait to start on that journey right away!<br><br>I have taken many computer science classes in my childhood so far, both in school and outside of school. In Middle School, I participated in the TSA club with one of my friends, where I learned many problem solving and tech-y skills. So far in one year of High School, I took AP Computer Science Principles where I learned all about Python. Outside of school, I have taken part in many extracurricular classes with small groups including ones for Python games and web designing.<br><br>I am on my way to major in math and computer science and start my life fresh. I love data science and AI, it is my field of interest and I think having all of this background in computer science will strongly provide me with the necessary skills I need to quickly progress and add my personal touch to the world.<br><br>I want to take part in the current action to take big steps in the AI field. AI is taking over, and I want to help develop it. I want to ensure it doesn't go rogue and I want to be right there, in the development process, and sharing my ideas with others. I have big hopes and dreams for our world to come, and I really believe I need to put myself out there in order for those dreams to come true.</p>
